 ## Testing
 
 ### Responsive Mobile-First Design
 
 The website has been tested on Mobile, Tablet & Desktop with each feature and section being tested numerous times
 to ensure that the responsiveness has no errors. I tested on all devices in Chrome DevTools and I tested each feature
 through each breaking point. I added on 'Responsive Web Design Tester' to my Chrome and tested my website with many
 different displays varying from portrait to landscape.
 
 Some of my friends volunteered to have a look through the website on their devices. The devices that the website has
 been tested on are as follows:
 * Desktop PC
 * MacBook Pro
 * iPad
 * iPhone 5, 5 SE, 6, 7, 8
 * Samsung
 

 ### Issues Encountered With Responsiveness
 
 * #### Navbar Links dropping to next line
   From '768px - 773px', there was a break where the Navbar links were moving to the second line. I fixed this
   by shortening down the word spacing on the navbar logo.
 
 * #### Album images jumping
   Throughout medium and small display, images were jumping onto the next line at certain breaking points. With changing
   the margins and font sizes, I was able to overcome the issue. 

 * #### Tickets not sitting correctly
   It was difficult to ensure that all tickets in the tickets section were responsive, I had an issue with the text and button
   sitting inside of the border. I added media queries to manipulate paddings and margins and everything eventually worked ok.
 

 ### Issues still to be fixed
 
 * #### Dates field in the form
   After running my code through the 'Markup Validation Service', it recommended using 'Polyfill' to ensure the dates field
   is compatible with older browsers. I will learn more about 'Polyfill' at a later date.
